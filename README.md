# MyFirstMicrogame

Project Title: My First Microgame

Description:
For my microgame I chose the 2D platformer microgame unity template to edit, since it is a familiar topic and coding style. The template already had many basic mechanics like jumping, walking, enemies and picking up items. I decided to add two seperate mechanics to the movement, since it felt slow and bulky, I added a double jump and a dash. The double jump was basically just a counter that would reset to 2 everytime you touched the ground. (Meaning if you fell off of a ledge you could store a double jump which I thought was cool) The dash (Left Shift) was a short boost of movement speed on the x-axis that had a short timer to refill.

Setup Instructions: just press play idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Reflection: 
The hardest part for me was just to find the movement script, since I'm not really used to editing code that I haven't personally made. After that it was pretty simple to add the double jump and dash mechanics, since I've had a lot of experiences with Unity and C# in the past already.
